# Part 3.10 - Production Certificate

Now again forcefully issue your certificate like we did before ([Part 3.7](007-acme-certificates.md)).

This time it you should receive a valid and trusted SSL certificate. Make sure to check the [ACME log](008-acme-log.md) for any errors though!

## Process

In your OPNsense GUI, Preform the following;
- Navigate to **`Services --> ACME Client --> Certificates`**  
  -> Click the button indicated in the [reference](#reference) below.
